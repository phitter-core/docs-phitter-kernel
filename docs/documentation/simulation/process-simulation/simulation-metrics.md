# Simulation Metrics

If you want to identify>

- Average Simulation Time per process
- Average Simulation Total Time
- Standard Deviation Time per process
- Standard Deviation Total Time

You should use the method `.simulation_metrics()`. That method **does not** have any argument.

```python
# Review simulation metrics
simulation.simulation_metrics()
```
