# Graphing the Process Simulation

Visualizing the simulation flow can confirm whether processes have been configured correctly. The `process_graph` method provides a graphical representation of all defined processes and their interconnections.

```python
# Generate a visualization of the process layout
simulation.process_graph()
```

The example below corresponds to the configuration described in the [Complete Process Example](#complete-process-example). When executed, it produces an output similar to:

![Graph Image](/simulation/process_simulation.png)

## `simulate.process_graph()`

Additional features are available through the following arguments:

-   **`graph_direction (str, optional)`**: Determines the graphâ€™s orientation. Possible values are `'LR'` (left-to-right) or `'TB'` (top-to-bottom). Defaults to `'LR'`.
-   **`save_graph_pdf (bool, optional)`**: Indicates whether the resulting graph should be saved as a PDF file. Defaults to `False`.

For instance, to generate a top-to-bottom graph and export it as a PDF, include:

```python
simulation.process_graph(graph_direction="TB", save_graph_pdf=True)
```
