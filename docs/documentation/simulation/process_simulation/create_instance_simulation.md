# Create an Instance Simulation

To create a process simulation, first of all you will need to initialize the object simulation.

In order to do that, you have to do the following:

```python
from phitter import simulation

# Create a simulation process instance
simulation_example = simulation.ProcessSimulation()
```

Hurray! ðŸ˜Ž

You have created a simulation instance. Now you can review how to create Process Simulation
