# Creating a Simulation Instance

In order to initialize a process simulation, it is first necessary to import the `simulation` module from the Phitter library. The following example demonstrates how to instantiate a new process simulation object:

```python
from phitter import simulation

# Instantiate a process simulation
simulation_example = simulation.ProcessSimulation()
```

Once this code is executed, a `ProcessSimulation` instance called `simulation_example` is created. It can then be configured and used to model various processes.
