# Run Continuous Fit

In order to run the fit option you need to use the method `.fit()` that has the following parameters:

- `n_workers (int, optional)`: The number of workers to use for fitting the distributions (default is 1).

You can run the fit as follows

```python
phi.fit(n_workers=4)
```

After that you can continue to review the possible fits.
